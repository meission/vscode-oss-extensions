First you have to install code-d in VSCode like any other extension from the side panel.

## First time installing D

If you don't have D installed, code-d will open the [D compiler download page](https://dlang.org/download.html) for you where you simply select your compiler of choice and install it for your OS.

If you are on Windows, you will probably need to restart your PC after D is installed so it is accessible in the PATH from within VSCode and its extensions.

After you are done, reload VSCode (F1 -> Developer: Reload Window) and open a D project, everything should work now.

## Verifying functionality

First open a folder with a D project or a blank one to create a project in. With a folder opened, simply open any D file and then in the bottom panels, check the **Output** tab.

In here at the right you should see a drop-down menu. If you can see `code-d & serve-d` in this then it means the extension is working and running.

If you experience any issues, check this tab for possible errors and log for debugging purposes when submitting an issue.

For more information in case something doesn't work, refer to [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
